    Beware of AWS account ID leaks.

    AWS account ID is a credential (12-digit number). Once this leaks, an attacker may identify essential information
    on your AWS account, such as roles, users, etc.

  justification:
    - When this is not an AWS account ID.
    - When this is not a problem if it leaks. (such as test data)
