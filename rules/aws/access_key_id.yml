  severity: warn
  message: |
    It may be dangerous to commit the AWS access key ID.

    AWS access key ID is an important credential that allows you to use AWS programmatically.
    Once this leaks, an attacker can access and operate your AWS resources.

  justification:
    - When this is not an AWS access key ID.
    - When this leakage is not a problem. (such as test data)
